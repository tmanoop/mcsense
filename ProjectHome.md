The collection of smart phones carried by people can be used for large scale sensing of the physical world by leveraging the cameras, microphones, GPSs, accelerometers, and other sensors on the phones. In order to verify that smartphone sensing is scalable, reliable, and cost-effective, we built and deployed McSense platform. For campus students to participate in the research study, McSense app is provided in Android market.
